# Paradigm-CardGame

## Description
I chose to solve a problem involving a card game from codeforces (1400) 
The solution required must  reconstruct the sequence of rounds played in a card game based on a given set of rules. Each round involves two players playing a card, with the second player needing to beat the card played by the first.
I had to adapt my solution to this problem by adding the use of a CFG

The **modeling technique** i decided to use is a secuence diagram
